How does this program works?

First you need to add new product by clicking on the tab "DODAJ NOVI PROIZVOD" in the
navigation bar.
It will open a new input form in which you are able to add new product to the class.

First field demands ID of the product which can be composed of 4 characters exactly.
In second and third field you input price and quantity of the product. 
By clicking the button "Dodaj" at the end of the input form you add new product to the class.
The new product shows up below the input form in the little squares.*

Next thing you can do is to calculate the multiplication of quantity and the price of the exact
product in the class, by clicking the middle tab in the navigation, called "IZRAÈUNAJ SUMU".

New input form drops down. In the first field you input product ID and click button "Izracunaj".
If you input nonexistent ID the alert message pops out, else it will print out the price,
quantity and multiplication of those two.

The third tab in the navigation bar allows you to update the state of the products
added to the class.

Ofcourse first you need to type in the right product ID in the first field.
Then you select to update quantity or price of the product, do you want to add or reduce it
and the last you input the new value for which you wish to update the old value.
And you click the "Dodaj" button at the end.

*The special, secret functionality is the drag and drop of the product in the class. 
Try it out ;)
